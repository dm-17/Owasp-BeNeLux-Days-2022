  name    : Grant Ongers
  bio     : >-
            Co-founder of Secure Delivery and current OWASP Global Foundation
            board member, Grant Ongers (@rewtd), is a firm believer in security
            enabling delivery, not blocking it. Well known in the international
            InfoSec community (it's hard to forget the beard!), his 10+ years'
            experience in Dev, 20 years in Ops and 30 years in Sec (mostly white hat)
            has made him a firm believer that there's no such thing as DevSecOps -
            just DevOps done right, and that compliance != security (or the other
            way around). Alongside his role as CTO within Secure Delivery, Grant
            provides C-suite advice and guidance on security to FTSE100 enterprises
            and strategic risk analysis within M&A diligence teams.
  title   : 100x your AppSec Program
  abstract: >-
            Developers outnumber security folks about 100 to 1. They are super
            smart and they care about the code that they write. Getting developers
            onboard with your AppSec program is how to scale your ability to secure
            all that code a hundred times better than we can today. There are a
            number of OWASP projects we use to help do this both commercially and
            as part of the work we are doing in the OWASP Open Application Security
            Curriculum project.

  name    : Ben Brucker
  bio     : >-
            With over 8 years of experience, Ben Brücker is Secura's domain lead
            for Red Teaming and a senior security specialist. As an avid fan of
            Social Engineering, he specializes in initial access techniques
            where he obtains access via any means necessary, whether it be
            phishing, vishing or physical entry. Also, in his role as Red
            Teaming lead it is Ben's responsibility to continually improve
            Secura's RT service offering.<br>
            Besides his operational work, Ben is a trainer for a number of
            courses, including a Secure Programming, Mobile Security, and
            Threat Modeling course.
  title   : Social engineering and physical entry, a Red Teamer's toolbox
  abstract: >-
            As a hacker, obtaining access to companies is generally getting
            harder and harder as a result of better security posture and more
            secure networks and software. However, how secure is your
            organization when a hacker just walks into your building?
            In this talk Ben will show you the motivations and techniques
            of attackers that resort to this initial access tactic.<br>
            Examples will be shown from Secura's own physical social
            engineering assessments that were performed in a Red Teaming context.
            In addition, Ben will demonstrate a number of tools that Secura's
            Red Team is using to break into secure organizations. So, do you
            want to see in real life how to clone a physical key or a badge,
            and how to use lockpicks and other fun tools? Join this talk!

  title   : Security by Meme - Less FUD, more FUN
  abstract: >-
            Let's make security fun again. With a pile of memes, I will make
            you laugh and show you security can be easy and fun.<br>
            Security experts are perfectly capable of scaring us with FUD:
            Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. Horror stories of accounts hacked
            in seconds, Bank accounts and Crypto wallets drained, smart
            devices taken over and baby monitors and home security cameras
            spying on their owners.<br>While those stories are in theory
            true, they also scare us into thinking security is nearly
            impossible, even for experts. Yes, there is no such thing as
            100% security. But we can achieve 99% more security with only
            1% effort.<br>
            Let me take you on a trip through Security by meme.

  title   : INCONTROLLER - New Malware Developed to Target Industrial Control Systems
  abstract: >-
            Only a few times in history we have seen publicly documented malware
            developed to target industrial control systems (ICS). Over ten years
            ago STUXNET impacted Iranian nuclear centrifuges. Then INDUSTROYER
            turned off electric power in Ukraine and TRITON targeted the safety
            systems from a critical infrastructure organization. Today, a
            couple years later, we ran into INCONTROLLER.<br>
            INCONTROLLER is a set of novel ICS- oriented attack tools built
            to target specific Schneider Electric and Omron devices that
            are embedded in different types of machinery leveraged across
            multiple industries. The tools – which are very likely
            state-sponsored – represent an exceptionally rare and dangerous
            cyber-attack that contains capabilities related to disruption,
            sabotage, and potentially physical destruction. In this talk I
            will present our analysis of INCONTROLLER, its components, attack
            scenarios, and the implications for defenders.

            for designing secure software, as well as empirical investigations
            on the human aspects of secure software engineering.
  title   : Assessing the state of practice of threat modeling in Dutch organizations
  abstract: >-
            We are currently conducting an empirical research project (in the
            form of interviews) on the use of security threat modeling in
            several large Dutch corporations, commissioned by the Dutch NCSC.
            Our goal is to describe the current state of practice regarding
            threat modeling, by mapping how threat modeling is embedded within
            the organizations, which roles are involved, how threat modeling
            activities are conducted in practice, and what are the experiences
            of the participants. While this research is still ongoing, in this
            talk we will present the research process, our own experiences as
            researchers, and offer a glimpse at some preliminary findings and
            insights.

  title   : When hackers and cats help - Redesigning security during a crisis
  abstract: >-
            In 2020, when the pandemic started, scientists suggested to also
            digitally support fighting the pandemic. One of the suggestions
            was digitally supported contact tracing. After first asking the
            market for solutions the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and
            Sport decided to
            self build open, privacy friendly, secure and accessible solutions
            with help of a large open source community. When vaccinations
            became available and timeframes for building solutions were near
            impossible the next step was clear: get hackers involved. This
            isn’t just to stick to the values, but also to create solutions
            in ways that aren’t always common for governments. How do you hack
            processes and rules to create what some ministries called magic?
            This talk will tell the inside hacker tale of the pandemic and
            show the dilemmas that were overcome.<br>
            This is a story of hackers in a ministry at the heat of the moment.
