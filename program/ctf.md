<h1>What is OWASP WrongSecrets in CTF mode?</h1>
<br>
<img src="/assets/images/ctf/image1.png">

<p>
Play head to head against other contestants in a secrets hunt which spawns
strawling through Git code, disecting Docker containers, finding
misconfigurations in Kubernetes, overcoming cloud challenges, reverse
engineering of binaries, and even makes you dive into Web3 secrets! <br>
</p>

<img src="/assets/images/ctf/image2.png">


<p>All of this on a virtualized environment, so all you have to do , is bring a
laptop with Wifi, a browser, and Docker!
</p>

<br><br>
<h1>What do you need to play?</h1>

<ul>
<li>a laptop with</li>
<li>a recent version of Docker;</li>
<li>a modern web-browser (Recent version of Chrome or alike is recommended),</li>
<li>a Working Wifi!</li>
<li>the AWS CLI</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>What could help, but is not strictly required</h2>
<p>Any tool that allows you for easy reverse-engineering like:
<ul>
<li>Radare2<div class="italic">(Don't worry: you will have a virtual environment where Radare2 waiting for you...)</div></li>
<li>Ghidra</li>
<li>Git</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You can even play part of the exercises on your tablet if you want
to &#128540;.
<br>But we doubt whether you will finish first &#128540; as others
might be racing to the finish line. <br>
So bring that laptop well prepared and get ready for some fun hacking!</p>

<div class="ctf">
<br><br>
<h1>Will I be able to do this?</h1>
<p>YES!!! We tested this CTF with a wide range of people: <br>
<ul>
<li>From your old-school OPS specialist, to your modern SRE-cloud-engineer... </li>
<li>From your awesome script-writer to your modern full-stack developer... </li>
<li>From the awesome pentester, till the heavily trained red-teamer... </li>
</ul>
And all of them had one thing in common:<br>
<div class="inverted">They had fun doing the exercises!</div></p>
<br><br>

<p><div class="italic">"But I am a business/salesman/analyst/a nurse/a physicist!"</div><br>
&rarr; Even for you there are challenges that will give you points and help you
understand secrets management on the way</p>
